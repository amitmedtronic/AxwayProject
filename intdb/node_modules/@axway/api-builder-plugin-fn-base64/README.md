# @axway/api-builder-plugin-fn-base64

## About

This plugin installs the Base64 flow-node to be used within [Axway API Builder's](https://www.axway.com/en/datasheet/axway-api-builder)
flow editor. The flow-node provides two methods:


### Encode
Encodes data into a string using the base64 encoding scheme. If the data is a Buffer or a string, its bytes will be encoded as-is. Otherwise, the data will be first converted using JSON.stringify, and then encoded.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | number\|boolean\|string\|object | y | The data to encode. |


### Decode
Decodes a base64 encoded string into the provided format (see "Decode data as" parameter).

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | string | y | The base64 encoded string. |
| as | boolean\|buffer\|number\|object\|string | n | If "buffer", data will be returned as a Buffer. If "string", data will be converted to utf-8 String. If "number", the data will be converted to a utf-8 string and then parsed as base 10 integer. If "boolean”, the data will be converted to a utf-8 string and if "false", "0", or empty string, the value is false (otherwise, true). If "object", the value is converted to a utf-8 string and parsed using JSON.parse. Default: buffer |

## Getting started

The "Base64" flow-node will then be available in the tools panel when creating or editing Flows.
