# @axway/api-builder-plugin-fn-logger

An API Builder plugin for logging.

## About

This plugin installs the Logger flow-node to be used within [Axway API Builder's](https://www.axway.com/en/datasheet/axway-api-builder) flow editor.

## Install

After creating your API Builder service (`api-builder init`), you can install this plugin using npm:

```bash
npm install @axway/api-builder-plugin-fn-logger
```

The "Logger" flow-node will be then available in the tools panel when creating or editing Flows.

## Usage

Check our docs on [How to use the Logger plugin](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/api-builder/page/docs/developer_guide/flows/flow_nodes/logger_flow_node/index.html).

## Methods
### Log

Writes a message to the log.

| Param | Description | Type | Default | Configuration selection | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| message | The log message. | string | - | Selector, String | Yes |
| level | The desired log level of the output logs. | string | info | Selector, String | No |

!> **NOTE:** The output logs would be only visible when the configured level is greater than or equal to the application's config logLevel in order of most-to-least verbose: trace, debug, info, warn, error.
