- #6732: When an instance of `APIBuilder` is not found, (which can occur when testing from a sub-directory of an API Builder project), a config will not be generated for the OAS plugin. Instead of throwing `no @axway/api-builder-runtime instance`, it will now just emit a warning.

Now, references are correctly encoded.
